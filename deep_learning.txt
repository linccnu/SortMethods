3.Separable convolution contain spatial separable convolution and depth-wise separable convolution.
    Depth-wise separable convolution usually undergoes channel-wise separable convolution, then point-wise 1*1 convolution;
    Spatial separable convolution also usually undergoes

4. The 1*1 convolution can increase or reduce the channel/depth of the feature map on one hand, it can also apply
    non-linearity, when followed by some activation layer, such as relu or elu.
